#Problem Set 4: Geometry

##Description
In this project you will explore calibrating a camera with respect to 3D world coordinates as well as estimating the relationship between two camera views.

## Setup
Clone this repository recursively:
`git clone --recursive https://github.gatech.edu/omscs6476/ps04.git`

(If your version of git does not support recurse clone, then clone without the option and tun `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`).
