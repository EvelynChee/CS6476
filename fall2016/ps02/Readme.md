#Problem Set 2: Edges and Lines

##Description
This problem set is your first “vision” project where you compute an “answer” – that is, some structural or semantic description as to what is in an image. You will find edges and objects.

## Setup
Clone this repository recursively:
`git clone --recursive https://github.gatech.edu/omscs6476/ps02.git`

(If your version of git does not support recurse clone, then clone without the option and tun `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`).

The problem set requirements are in this link:
