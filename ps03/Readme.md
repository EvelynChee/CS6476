# Problem Set 3: Window-Based Stereo Matching

##Description
In class and in Forsyth and Ponce, chapter 7 we discussed window-based approaches to estimating dense stereo correspondence. In this problem set you will implement such approaches and evaluate it on some standard stereo pairs. 

## Setup
Clone this repository recursively:
`git clone --recursive https://github.gatech.edu/omscs6476/ps03.git`

(If your version of git does not support recurse clone, then clone without the option and tun `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`).

##Instructions
If you have questions, please post them to Piazza.

The problem set requirements can be found in this link:
